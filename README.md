# UX
 The objective is for two players to take turns dropping their discs into a grid, aiming to connect four of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before their opponent.

# Features
Two-player gameplay 
Simple and intuitive interface
Real-time winner detection
Visual representation of the board
Reset and replay options

# How to Play
Players take turns dropping a disc into one of the 7 columns.
The discs fall to the lowest available space in that column.
The first player to connect four discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If the grid is full and no player has connected four discs, the game is a draw.

# UX Design Choices
Responsive Input: The player can click (or tap) on the column where they want to drop their disc. Hovering over a column will highlight it, improving the gameâ€™s responsiveness.
Immediate Feedback: When a player makes a move, the game immediately displays where the disc is dropped and checks for a winner, providing instant feedback.
Color-Coded Discs: Player 1 has red discs, and Player 2 has yellow discs, following the traditional color scheme of Connect 4 for ease of recognition.
Reset Button: A reset button allows players to easily start a new game without refreshing the page or restarting the application.
Responsive Design: The game adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring it can be played on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
